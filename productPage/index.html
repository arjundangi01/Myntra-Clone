          T-shirts are without a doubt every mans favourite garment. They are
          versatile, stylish and can be worn in a million different ways. In
          fact, there are so many varieties when it comes to t-shirts for men
          that it could be difficult to settle on a particular kind while
          shopping. A t-shirt can be styled even with shirts for men to create
          fun ensembles that are semi-formal or smart casual. There is a t-shirt
          for men that can complement any kind of lowers that you might have in
          mind, be it track pants, lounge shorts or innerwear.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can also select and style a t-shirt for men according to the
          season and occasion, which means that the same garment could be used
          to create completely different looks entirely depending on the
          scenario and weather. However, to be able to do this successfully, you
          must first have an understanding of styling t-shirts and your personal
          preference; this includes how you would like to project yourself. Read
          on to find out more.
        </p>
        <h5>STYLING A T-SHIRT FOR MEN</h5>
        <p>
          We have covered the basics and thrown in a couple of tricks to style a
          t-shirt for men in the best way, so read on and take notes.
          <br /><br />
          Colours
          <br /><br />
          When it comes to a t-shirt for men, there are a few colours which are
          essential in any wardrobe. These are the most basic colours which will
          set the tone for your collection; they are white, black, navy blue and
          grey. Apart from this, you can also add on dark shades of maroon,
          green and brown to mix and match with your joggers or tracksuits.
          <br /><br />
          Fits
          <br /><br />
          Generally speaking, the fits of t-shirts for men range from long-line,
          regular, slim, fitted and loose. There is no set rule in particular
          when it comes to choosing one over the other. Having said that, you
          must take time to know what works best with your body type and fashion
          sensibilities. For instance, a fitted t-shirt for men would flatter a
          fit physique or can work to be an inner layer, for a winter look.
          <br /><br />
          Necklines
          <br /><br />
          The three most common necklines are crew, scoop and V-neck but there
          are combinations and variations of these too. You are likely to notice
          that the crew neckline is the most versatile style and is worn widely.
          To start off your collection, you can work with an understanding of
          the above-mentioned options and choose accordingly.
        </p>

          Polo Ralph Lauren Cotton Blend Fleece Pullover
          <br /><br />

          have a vintage look. The grey melange and navy colours complement
          cargo pants or lounge shorts and will look great paired with white
          sneakers.

            WHAT ARE THE LATEST TRENDS IN MEN'S T-SHIRTS?
            <p>
              Here are some of the latest trends in the men's T-shirt categories
              that you can shop from:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Typography: Men's T-shirts have seen a new trend with
                culture-defining quotes printed on them. The minimalist look of
                the T-shirt makes them a perfect option for all sorts of events.
                They come in a variety of colours and can be paired with a
                jacket for parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                Super Hero T-shirts: Men's obsession with comic books has come
                to an all-time high. Owning a T-shirt of their favourite
                superhero can generate a sense of pride and motivation.

            WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DESIGNING A MEN'S T-SHIRT AND WOMEN'S
            T-SHIRT?
            <p>
              The differences between men's and women's T-shirts lies in the
              physical facets of the design.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                T-shirts for women are designed to be shorter than those for
                men.
              </li>
              <li>
                Men's T-shirts are usually intended to be fitted around the
                chest and then flow loosely from there. Women's T-shirts are
                meant to flatter the curves and are more form-fitting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Women's T-shirts have cap sleeves whereas men's T-shirt arms are
                slightly longer.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
